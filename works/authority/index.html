            <span class="work_blurb">How do societal deformities manifest themselves both in individuals and as a collective? How deeply embedded are these defects in the fabric of our society? Is the individual selfishness a mirror of the collective or is it that the collective fabric has rotten exposing these putrid values? At what point can or should one start to point fingers?<br><br>This ongoing project questions the daily relations within a society while trying to make some sense of one's own role. How society is steered by a shapeless entity called authority that most often manifests itself through corrupted human nature, broken human relationships, moral and religious codes. This work revolves around the self-attribution of authority to conclude, admit, deny, approve, reject, support or oppose. Everything is brought to question, from the most insignificant freedoms to politics, religion and soccer.</span>

                <p class="work_description">While researching the better understanding of our being and the reality that we contextualize ourselves in, we come across the antinomy of light having the duality of being particle and wave at the same time. When left unobserved, light acts as a wave, but when measured, light acts as a particle. Where does this ability come from or is it simply inherent from quantum consciousness?</p><p class="work_description">While quantum physics decrees that the observer determines the existence, we can't not wonder what happens to everything that leaves our field of vision once we turn our gaze. Does what we don't see really fall out from existence and then, spring back into existence once we look at it again?</p><p class="work_description">In an attempt to demonstrate this duality, x-rays, made by a radiology specialist, were contact printed over silver gelatin paper that was previously exposed with negatives of the corresponding body part of the artist, photographically captured by a third person.</p><p class="work_description">The asseverations of this pseudo-scientific research are further elucidated by a philosophical approach towards our incomprehension of the quantum consciousness predicated to all matter, and, at this point, we start to question the function of representation, once it has already been established that the existence can only be determined by the observer.</p><p class="work_description">This project was made for Beirut Art Fair 2018 and shown with Artlab Gallery.</p>

You manage to get something done or get away with something because you have "wasta", meaning you are close to an influential or political figure that can clear you up with one phonecall. It is this wasta mentality that brought Lebanon to the state it finds itself in, to its knees.</p>

A roll of film is exposed and kept for a certain amount of time, randomly decided by the artist, and only then developed. The result is a total surprise and a trip back to the past.</p><p class="work_description">This roll of film was shot in August 1994 and was only developed in December 2017. These photographs were taken in the Basta neighborhood in Beirut. But that is the most the artist can remember about these forgotten people.</p><p class="work_description">Two hundred poster were printed and were made available in this exhibition. Along with the time shift, the artist proposed that every visitor took a poster to hang somewhere on the street, thus allowing for a full shift in space-time.</p>

                <p class="work_description">On an ongoing study of social exclusion and social disorders, we come across seven ailments that have gravely infected and, therefore, affect our society. These diseases all originate in the mind and find a path to become physically and/or socially manifested.</p><p class="work_description">By floating oil colors on water, we capture the micro formations of these cellular shifts and take an imprint on a small sheet of cotton paper materializing tissue slides from unavailable tissue blocks. Once dry, these slides are labeled with the name of the pathology and further undergo numbering, diagnose, prognosis, date stamp, and final conclusion by the pseudo-pathologist. The slides are incapsulated between two sheets of plexiglass and sealed in place with metal clips in a final attempt to promote the isolation of the malady.</p><p class="work_description">Curiously, these illnesses have one common element that is the lack of any medical treatment or pharmaceuticals to minimize or to revert the prognosis. Alternatives like Bach�s florals, homeopathy, and oriental medicine have also proven to be ineffective across the board. So far, the only proven betterment of the symptoms were achieved by alienating the patients and sending them abroad, to a civilized society, for a period of 18 to 24 months. In some isolated patients, a longer s�jour allowed for the prognosis to be completely reverted.</p>
